About me
======
I am a researcher in Engineering with Artificial Intelligence (AI) for applications in Nonlinear Materials and Structural systems, currently a Senior Research Associate in Data Science for Materials Engineering at the University of Bristol (UK). My work sits at the intersection of computational mechanics and dynamics, machine learning, and experimental nonlinear dynamics, with the overarching goal of developing data-centric frameworks for multiscale modelling and digital twins of engineering systems under extreme operational conditions.

My research focuses on bridging physics and data through physics-informed learning and surrogate modelling to accelerate the simulation and design of material and structural systems. I developed efficient ML surrogates that connect microstructural dynamics to component-scale rapid, predictive simulations of metallic systems that retain physical interpretability.

My broader expertise spans multiscale nonlinear dynamics, system identification, and experimental testing. I have contributed to the design of Ultrasonic Fatigue Testing (UFT) systems for additively manufactured metals, integrated AI-driven model calibration workflows, and collaborated with international research groups such as the Tribomechadynamics Lab at Rice University.

My long-term vision is to advance explainable, data-efficient, and physics-grounded AI for materials and structural systems—pushing toward the next generation of intelligent, interpretable digital materials and structures that underpin sustainable and resilient engineering design.
